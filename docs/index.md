# SEO Deliverable Prompt Library

Welcome to a production-ready prompt library designed to help SEO professionals generate client-ready deliverables for every phase of a website growth campaign.

## What this knowledge base includes

- End-to-end prompts across discovery, strategy, implementation, and reporting.
- Reusable templates with placeholders for any niche, location, and business model.
- Structured outputs that can be pasted directly into decks, proposals, briefs, and SOPs.
- Tags for skill level and use case (`beginner`, `advanced`, `technical`, `creative`).

## Quick-start guide

1. Start in **Getting Started** and copy the customization framework.
2. Move phase-by-phase in chronological order as you onboard a new client.
3. Replace placeholders (e.g., `[WEBSITE_URL]`, `[INDUSTRY]`) before running prompts.
4. Ask your AI model to return outputs in markdown tables and executive summary format.
5. Save outputs into your client workspace and iterate with follow-up prompts.

## Search tips

- Use quotes for exact phrases (e.g., `"core web vitals"`).
- Combine terms like `technical + advanced` to find implementation-heavy prompts.
- Filter by prompt intent: `audit`, `strategy`, `brief`, `report`, `optimization`.

> Tip: Start every new client project by running the Discovery prompts first, then use Strategy prompts to prioritize actions.
